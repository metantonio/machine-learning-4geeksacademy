    "As machine learning engineers we will probably have to interact with SQL databases in order to access data. SQL means Structured Query Language. The key difference between SQL and Python is that developers use SQL to access and extract data from a database, whereas developers use Python to analyze and manipulate data by running regression tests, time series tests and other data processing computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some popular SQL databases are SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL. SQLite is best known for being an integrated database. This means that we don't have to install an extra application or use a separate server to run the database. It moves fast but has limited functionality, so if we dont' need a ton of data storage space, we will want to use a SQLite database. On the other hand, PostgreSQL and MySQL have database types that are great for enterprise solutions. If we need to scale fast, MySQL and PostgreSQL are the best bet. They'll provide long-term infrastructure, bolster security, and handle high performance activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we'll see how Python and some SQL databases interact. Why should we care about connecting Python and a SQL database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps, as machine learning engineers, we will need to build an automated ETL pipeline. Connecting Python to a SQL database will allow us to use Python for its automation capabilities. We'll also be able to communicate between different data sources. We won't have to switch between different programming languages, we'll be able to use our Python skills to manipulate data from a SQL database. We won't need a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to remember is that Python can integrate with each database type. Python and SQL databases connect through custom Python libraries. You can import these libraries into your Python script.\n",
